        <section class="content"><p>Today I read a post on reddit that reminded me of why I spend so much time on that site.  It all started out with a post titled &quot;Worlds Population&quot; and linked to the followig image.

</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sJotonD.jpeg" alt="initial awesome map">

</p>
<p>Looking at this, it seriously blew my mind.  However I didn&apos;t have the reaction that a few on the comments did when they pointed out that the amount of land within that circle is actually much larger than displayed.  Looking further throught the comments I found this was definitely true and, of course, a relevant XKCD.  

</p>
<p>It started when someone posted this image of the actual size of Africa that obviously conflicted with the posted images scale. 

</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uGTm3Wv.jpg" alt="zomg africa map">

</p>
<p>Along with an awesomely relevant West Wing clip (I&apos;ve always had this on my to watch list but it&apos;s now right at the top and on netflix!) that&apos;s definitely worth the 4 min watch.  

</p>

<p>Finally culiminating in a great revised map created by another redditor showing, in fact, how much larger the area is.

</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/N7yPa7z.jpg" alt="super cool map">

</p>
<p>Please forgive the basically reposting of a reddit post, I know it happens often enough already.  However this seriously blew my mind so much I really wanted to at least save it so I could reference it later.  I always knew of the other maps you could reference but never understood how big a difference they actually presented.`

        <section class="content"><p>Wanted to make a quick post about the new site I just finished up recently called Horae (Hoe-rai).  This site is basically just a wrapper for the Metra rail-time tracker on their site.  I built it out partially because their UI wasn&apos;t ideal and also to try and make something super simple so everyone could use it.  

</p>
<p>The result is <a href="http://horae.herokuapp.com">Horae</a>.  

</p>
<p>It&apos;s mobile optimized so you can easily check the train status at the station or quickly bring up the upcoming trains as you&apos;re walking there.  I know the design leaves something to be desired but give me a break I&apos;m just getting into this whole HTML/CSS thing :).  

</p>
<p>At any rate just wanted to make a quick post about it.  I might expand this later to go more in depth into the code but that&apos;ll have to wait for another night.

        <section class="content"><p>After many years I have finally taken the time to setup a real website that represents me.  It doesn&apos;t do anything and as such isn&apos;t very interesting.  However after looking around at the curtain style scrolling sites I&apos;d seen everywhere, the real inspriration came from the <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">Microsoft build conference website</a>.

</p>
<p><img src="/img/msft-build-screenie.png" alt="screenshot of the build page incase it is removed">

</p>
<p>Going off of this I tried to really take a shot at doing some interesting UI work (at least to me), as I haven&apos;t done real HTML UI work since… well ever really.  I also wanted to take this as an oppourtunity to try and learn some more CSS and specifically SASS.  Sass is seriously now my best friend, I used to hate doing css but sass I can grasp for some reason, the syntax of css I guess was just bugging me.  

</p>
<p>At any rate after working on it for quite a bit this is now the new website and the first thing that uses a browser that doesn&apos;t use javascript heavily that I&apos;ve worked on it a long time.  

</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alexthaler.com"><img src="/img/site-screenie.png" alt="it&apos;s sooo pretty!"></a>

</p>
<p>Let me know what you think, obviously the content of the site itself is still being hashed out but the site is functional and looks rather good I must say.   

</p>
<p>So take a look and let me know what you think.

        <section class="content"><p>Since we had a burst of warmth here in Chicago recently I figured I&apos;d clean up my grill to get ready for summer.  Earlier in the winter I had a sizeable grease fire take place and had to douce it with half a pound of flour, leaving it in this state.

<p>Now after a good cleaning it looks much less like there was a snow explosion.
