					I am a diligent, professional and responsible worker that enjoys playing around with code in my free time. I love technology and spend much of my free time reading up on the newest frameworks, languages and libraries.  In my free time I try to play around with anything that seems interesting or fun (see github account, lots of half completed projects).  While also trying to stay involved with the programming community (spend lots of time on meetup now). Outside of technology I enjoy watching sports (da bears), exploring new local brews, reading up on politics/current events and relaxing whenever possible.

				<span class="content">
					I have been programming since I was a kid, originally working on a green and black crt Tandy writing very simple BASIC programs.  From there I really lost interest for a while, regaining my love for programming once getting to high school and taking classes around VB.  While in college the infatuation with programming continued to grow focusing primarily on Java throughout my education, I also dabbled in Ruby however was still mostly backend.  I have 5 years of professional experience with Java and have some non-professional experience with JS and Ruby.

				<span class="content">When away from my keyboard I like to spend lots of time hanging out, relaxing, trying to decompress from the stress of deadlines and compiler errors.  During this time I like to read books across many differnet subjects (usually non-fiction).  Try to keep up with the news and politics as much as possible.  While also of course following my favorite sports teams (Da Bears!).</span>
