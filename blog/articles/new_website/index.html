        <section class="content"><p>After many years I have finally taken the time to setup a real website that represents me.  It doesn&apos;t do anything and as such isn&apos;t very interesting.  However after looking around at the curtain style scrolling sites I&apos;d seen everywhere, the real inspriration came from the <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">Microsoft build conference website</a>.

</p>
<p><img src="/img/msft-build-screenie.png" alt="screenshot of the build page incase it is removed">

</p>
<p>Going off of this I tried to really take a shot at doing some interesting UI work (at least to me), as I haven&apos;t done real HTML UI work sinceâ€¦ well ever really.  I also wanted to take this as an oppourtunity to try and learn some more CSS and specifically SASS.  Sass is seriously now my best friend, I used to hate doing css but sass I can grasp for some reason, the syntax of css I guess was just bugging me.  

</p>
<p>At any rate after working on it for quite a bit this is now the new website and the first thing that uses a browser that doesn&apos;t use javascript heavily that I&apos;ve worked on it a long time.  

</p>

</p>
<p>Let me know what you think, obviously the content of the site itself is still being hashed out but the site is functional and looks rather good I must say.   

</p>
<p>So take a look and let me know what you think.
