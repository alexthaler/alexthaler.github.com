        <section class="content"><p>Today I read a post on reddit that reminded me of why I spend so much time on that site.  It all started out with a post titled &quot;Worlds Population&quot; and linked to the followig image.

</p>

</p>
<p>Looking at this, it seriously blew my mind.  However I didn&apos;t have the reaction that a few on the comments did when they pointed out that the amount of land within that circle is actually much larger than displayed.  Looking further throught the comments I found this was definitely true and, of course, a relevant XKCD.  

</p>
<p>It started when someone posted this image of the actual size of Africa that obviously conflicted with the posted images scale.

</p>
<p>Along with an awesomely relevant West Wing clip (I&apos;ve always had this on my to watch list but it&apos;s now right at the top and on netflix!) that&apos;s definitely worth the 4 min watch.

<p>Finally culiminating in a great revised map created by another redditor showing, in fact, how much larger the area is.

<p>Please forgive the basically reposting of a reddit post, I know it happens often enough already.  However this seriously blew my mind so much I really wanted to at least save it so I could reference it later.  I always knew of the other maps you could reference but never understood how big a difference they actually presented.`
