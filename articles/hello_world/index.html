</p>
<p>The blog is now being generated using <a href="http://jnordberg.github.com/wintersmith/">wintersmith</a> which so far has been awesome (thanks jnordberg).  The change was partially because of my issues with Octopress and syncing across multiple repos.

</p>
<p>I am working on some tools to aid in publishing a blog with winterpress which I will probably post later.  Until then please bare with me and the odd themeing.
